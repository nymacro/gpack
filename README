GPack - GNU/Linux Package Manager (GPL)

See COPYING for license details.

!TESTING RELEASE!

See file "gpack.conf" for environment settings.

By default the package manager expects to be in ~/gpack-<version>/ (you can
just `tar xzf gpack-<version>.tar.gz -C ~` to install it in the proper place).
Another option is to edit gpack.conf file located in the extracted directory.

The script "gpack" is the public package manager interface. Make it
executable (`chmod +x gpack`) or use it as an argument to sh
(`sh gpack`).

Two example packages are provided, one a plain test package, the other
an actual working package. These packages are:
    io  - A small prototype based object-oriented prorgamming language
          released under the BSD license. There is no particular reason
          i chose this package, but i should have chose something under
          GPL which suits Sat GNU/Linux' philosophy more.
    test- A plain test package which doesn't do much.

To install on of these packages (or other packages you may want), use
the following command:
    gpack install <package name>

To remove the package, run:
    gpack remove <package name>

To see all the commands available to gpack, run gpack without any
arguments.


DIRECTORY MEANINGS:
_vfs    - Fake root file system (keeping host system clean when testing)
_info   - Installed package information
_root   - Package description/archive root

To change where the above directories are located, see "gpack.conf".
_vfs    = PKGVFS
_info   = PKGINFO
_root   = PKGROOT
