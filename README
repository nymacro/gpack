GPack - GNU/Linux Package Manager (GPL)

See COPYING for license details.

GPack is a simple but flexible package manager for GNU/Linux based systems
(but could be utilized on other systems which have standard GNU tools and
run GNU bash).

GPack aims to provide a simple, but flexible automated package building,
installation and management system. It aims to greatly reduce the work
required for building packages, while still giving the packager the power
required to complete the job successfully.

SETTING UP GPACK:
    You need to make sure that your gpack.conf file is modified for your
    system.

    PKG_FILE_DIR    - The directory containing the package and descriptors.
    PKG_CONF_DIR    - The directory containing the installed package info.
    PKG_ROOT_DIR    - The root installation directory for GPack install.
    PKG_LOG         - Log file for GPack builds (and other operations).
    PKG_PACKAGE_DIR - The directory which will contain all build pacakges.
    PKG_SOURCE_DIR  - The directory which will contain all downloaded source.

SPECIAL VARIABLES:
   FORCE_OVERWRITE  - Force package to overwrite files which already exist on
		      the system.
   FORCE_NO_DEPS    - Ignore dependancies.

BASIC USAGE:
    To build a package, simply run the following:
        ./gpack build packagename

    To install a package, simply run:
        ./gpack install packagename

    To remove a package:
        ./gpack remove packagename
