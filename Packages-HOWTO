PKGBUILD Howto

This document will give all the details required to build your own PKGBUILD files
and GPack packages.

PKGBUILD BASIC STRUCTURE:
    GPACK SPECIAL VARIABLES:
    SRC
        The directory where the source files were extracted.

    PKG
        The directory where all files which are to be in the package are located.

    VARIABLES:
    name
        Package Name

    version
        Package Version

    release
        Package Release

    license
        Package/Program License

    group
        Package Group

    depends
        Array of required dependancies.

        Dependancy Element Format:
            DependancyName >= version
                A version requirement (above of equal) for dependancy DependancyName.

            DependancyName <= version
                A version requirement (less than of equal) for dependancy DependancyName.

            DependancyName
                A simple dependancy without version requirements.

    optdeps
        Array of optional dependancies.

    sources
        Array of source files required to build the package.

    FUNCTIONS:
    build
        The main function which actually constructs the package.

    pre-install
        A function which is ran before installing the package.

    post-install
        A function ran after a package is installed.

    pre-remove
        A function ran before a package is removed from the system.

    post-remove
        A function ran after the package has been removed from the system.


PACKAGE BUILD PROCESS:
    The package build process is quite simple and can be followed in 5
    steps.

    1. GPack will check for the required dependancies, handling
    them appropriately.

    2. GPack will check to see if the source files are available
    locally (ie. if they have already been downloaded), if not GPack will
    proceed to download them (using GNU wget).

    3. GPack will extract any tar.gz and tar.bz2 files into the $SRC
    directory and then change the current directory to $SRC.

    4. GPack will then proceed to execute the function 'build', which will
    build the package and install _all_ files prefixed with $PKG.

    5. GPack then adds its own files to the directory $PKG before creating
    a tar.gz archive of the final package.
